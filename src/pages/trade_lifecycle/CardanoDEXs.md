## Cardano DEXs

**The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**

### The Good

In Q3 2021 the Cardano Dex, Muesli Swap, launched with little fanfare.

> MuesliSwap is planning to release version 2 of their smart contracts by the end of January. MuesliSwap v2 is audited by MLabs. MuslISwap is already seeing a trading volume of more than 2 million ADA daily and with more than 20,000 unique trades this shows the success of the MuesliSwap protocol.

### The Bad

Early in 2022 SundaeSwap made (unfortunate) headlines:
- [Cardano’s First DEX SundaeSwap Fails to Impress on Launch](https://beincrypto.com/cardanos-first-dex-sundaeswap-fails-to-impress-on-launch/)
- [Cardano-Based Decentralized Exchange SundaeSwap Off to Rocky Start](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/21/cardano-based-decentralized-exchange-sundaeswap-off-to-rocky-start/)
- [SundaeSwap Switcheroo Leaves CardStarter Users With Losses, Spreading Cardano Discord](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/26/sundaeswap-switcheroo-leaves-cardstarter-users-with-losses-spreading-cardano-discord/)


### The Ugly

- [Legal proceedings against SundaeSwap for fraud with cardstarter !!! ](https://pumpdumpcoin.com/forums/topic/legal-proceedings-against-sundaeswap-for-fraud-with-cardstarter/)

### Perception vs Reality

While the above is not meant to make this document into a cardano tabloid, it is relevant from the perspective of learning about the Cardano technical capabilities, especially regarding the trading latency and volume, and also crypto media perception and publicity. 

**MuesliSwap: The Cardano DEX with a Decentralized Order Book**

> “...we published our whitepaper which contains an in-depth treatment of how to conceptually build a DEX on an EUTXO-based blockchain such as Cardano, including discussions on how to best leverage concurrency, avoid contention, ensure fairness, and alike. These considerations are all necessary and important when developing a DEX.”

### Recommendations
As it is too early to pick Cardano DEX winners, continue monitoring.
Strive for winning a Cardano Catalyst funding round as this does raise our profile in the community and could lead to attracting both talent and capital.
Get experts to review source code of various, select, Cardano Plutus smart contracts
Run stress and load test simulations on private networks, keeping in mind this will not give completely accurate representation of real world network usage.


### Questions

- Is an Orderbook or AMM better for our needs and on Cardano?
- Is the above question too simple? Are there more nuanced and technical considerations?
