### Resource Estimations 

In various sections of this document resource estimatations are provided, in the form of 3 point estimations. 
These are presented, for example, like so:

#### Notes on Resource Estimations 
- The estimatations are mine alone, and should be reworked with expert input.
- They do not take into consideration any existing expertise, strategic decisions or other existing factors.
- The estimations are based on the relative task and topic only.
