## Automated Market Marker

Also known as **Constant Function Market Makers**.

Traders submit their buy and sell orders to a central market maker whose job
is to then match those orders following some matching strategy.


### Fair price formation mechanism

An AMM exchange aggregates liquidity for both sides of a trading pair into a pool. The AMM pool then determines a single market price according to a deterministic algorithm. The price formula is usually based on the poolâ€™s current liquidity, or in other words the availability of an asset in the pool.
